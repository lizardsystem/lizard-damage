lizard-damage
==========================================

Lizard-damage is the functionality of the "Waterschadeschatter" site,
in a Django app. It's also a Lizard app, but besides using the Lizard
base template, hardly any of its functionality is used.

There is a little bit of documentation in the doc/ directory.
